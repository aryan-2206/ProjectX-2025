# MuseGAN

## 🎯 Aim
To generate polyphonic music of multiple tracks (instruments) using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The models aims to generate 4 bars of multitrack coherent music from scratch for 5 instruments. We also aim to extend the model for Human-AI collaboration where 4 instrument tracks can be conditionally generated on the basis of one Human input track.

## 💃 Model Structure
The whole MuseGAN model is primarily split into 2 parts - Multitrack and Temporal Models.

### Multi-Track Model
This is further split into 3 types of models: Composer, Jamming and Hybrid models

<img width="400" height="350" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3521f6d0-e0fa-4ce6-a3bd-b05c0f9eec4e" />

- #### Composer Model
It is responsible for creating a uniformity across instruments of all the tracks by using a single generator and a single discriminator.
- #### Jamming Model
It is responsible for giving each instrument tracks its characteristic style by using 5 generators and discriminators for 5 tracks.
- #### Hybrid Model
The Hybrid Model merges both composer and jamming model into one single model using a global vector *Z* and 5 track-dependent vectors *Z<sub>i</sub>*

### Temporal Model
This model is responsible for encoding bar-specific temporal encodings to the latent vectors. Temporal Model also has two types:

- #### Generation From Sratch 
A Temporal Generator (*GTemp*) is used when 5 coherent tracks are to be generated from scratch.
- #### Conditional Generation
If a conditional track input is provided, A Temporal Encoder is used to encode the temporal characteristics of human-input track into the latent vectors.


### Overall Structure
<img width="600" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6bef2d8-74dd-438e-8bcf-a2204d3a3ea2" />

This incorporates both Temporal Generators and Bar Generators and consists of a Global Latent Vector, z, Global Temporal Vector, Z<sub>t</sub>, Track Dependent Latent Vectors, Z<sub>i</sub>, and Track Dependent Temporal Vectors, Z<sub>it</sub> 

## 📊 Data
The [LPD-5 Cleansed dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cloudoak/lpd-5-cleansed) is a curated version of the original Lakh Pianoroll Dataset (LPD-5), which itself is derived from the Lakh MIDI Dataset (LMD) containing MIDI files from various sources. It consists of over 60,000 multi-track piano-rolls, each aligned to 4/4 time. 

## 🚂 How To Train The Model
- Install the dependencies

    `pip install -r requirements`

- Go to the particular version folder you want to train and download the `.ipynb` file.
- Run the Nbk locally or in JupyterLab Notebooks 
- To access the trained checkpoint for a particular model, check the `README.md` file in the particular Version's folder

## 🎼 Outputs
To access the output audio, check out the Audio folder under the version Folder
